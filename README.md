Rating: 3.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Little to no income tax info
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 17, 2022
Review: I purchased this basically for info on income taxes payable by expat residents and it says to see an accountant LOL

Title: Up-to-date info in an easy to read format
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 22, 2022
Review: Loved the title of the book published by The Expat Homes Team. The fact that it was updated March 2022 was super important as so much is in flux since COVID travel bans have been lifted. The book covers so much of life as an expat in Portugal from daily life, the many possible visas, taxes, and even a useful preparation check list should one decide to make the move.

Title: Highly Recommend
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 12, 2020
Review: If you are considering a move to Portugal, this is the book for you. It is written by an accomplished expat who highlights all the necessary information to complete a successful transition to Portugal, which offers excellent hiking, surfing, sailing, golf, food, and weather. Portugal is an increasingly popular destination for people of all ages, however, in recent years, it has also seen an influx of retired people from The United States, Canada, and now the UK.

Portugal is a relatively small country, but it is also one of the oldest countries in the world, which is a large attraction for expats. There is lots of history to learn about and ancient sites to explore in Portugal. Additionally, Lisbon, the capital, is one of the oldest cities in Europe dating back to 400 years before the existence of the Roman Empire. In this expat guide, there are some great tips and tricks in this book to help expats get settled without too much difficulty, including a mini history lesson.

The tone is light and it is an easy read. All of the major areas you need to consider when making such a move are covered along with strategic info that will help you avoid common pitfalls and problems and make your transition easier. If you are looking for a comprehensive guide on relocation to Portugal, this is the book for you.

Title: Info
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 18, 2021
Review: I liked the information as it was clear and easy to understand. I had been researching on line as well as info from international living which also focuses in more detail about relocating to Portugal. All in all, the more info you have, the better!

Title: Don‚Äôt expect much
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 20, 2020
Review: Did I get my five bucks worth? Yes, for a basic explanation of the visa categories, and a few other tidbits I hadn‚Äôt quite gotten a clear answer on from Google. (I‚Äôd always wondered what T0, T1 & T2 mean in apartment listings and now I know.)

But would I call this a good book? Not exactly. The sections about Portuguese culture are absurd (their entire section on food is a couple of sentences about cod). There are bizarre detours, like the final chapter on how to create an online business (‚Äúfirst buy a domain name‚Äù). I would have expected a book with ‚Äúcomplete guide‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù in its title to offer a little more guidance on the complicated decisions that a potential expat needs to make. Some sample budgets for various regions and lifestyles would have been very useful. Also a little subjective description of what life is like for expats would have been welcome, and maybe an invitation to reflect on what you‚Äôre hoping to get out of the move abroad and how to achieve those goals.

If I bought a book this shallow about another major life decision - parenting or marriage or career - I‚Äôd be very disappointed. But if you set your expectations very low, you may get something out of it.

Title: Helpful intro for those considering an expat move to Portugal
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 18, 2020
Review: This is a well-written overview of the things potential expats should consider in evaluating a move to Portugal. It covers practical logistics, gives a brief overview of the leading cities / areas to move to, and gives helpful summaries of topics like visas, transportation, housing, healthcare, taxes, schools for kids, and starting a business in Portugal. The book packs a lot of digestible information in a short format (about 60 pages).

Review: This book is the perfect way to get all the information you need if you're looking to move to Portugal. A quick and informative read that provides everything you need to know from visas to transportation to even starting your own business! Worth every penny.
